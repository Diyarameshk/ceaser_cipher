# Caesar Cipher Encryption Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of Caesar Cipher encryption in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher in which each letter of the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Description

The Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on. The shift wraps around the alphabet, so 'Z' would become 'C'.

## Features

- Encrypts  a given plaintext using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Decrypts a given ciphertext using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Preserves spaces and other non-alphabetic characters in the plaintext.
